Machine learning 
- [ ] ML  is subset of AI 
- [ ] Focus off building algorithms  and statical models that allow computer to perform specific task without explicit programming.
- [ ] Instead ML systems learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions or decision based on that data.
- [ ] There are 3 primary types of ML
- [ ] 1]Supervised Learning-->
    - [ ] The mode trained by labeled data 
    - [ ] That means each training example has both input and expected output(the label)
    - [ ] Use Case:- Classification (e.g email spam detection ), regression(prediction house price) 
    - [ ] Examples :- Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machine
- [ ] 2]Unsupervised Learning
    - [ ] USL involves training data that has no label.
    - [ ] That Model tries to learn the underlying structure or patterns from the input data alone
    - [ ] UseCase- Clustering(groupings similar data), anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction 
    - [ ] Example :- k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, Principle component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] 3]Reinforcement Learning
    - [ ] Training Data:- In reinforcement learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving  feedback in the form of rewards or penalties
    - [ ] The goal is to maximise the cumulative rewards over time
    - [ ] UseCase: - Robotics, gaming, self-driving cars, recommendation systems.
    - [ ] Example :- Qlearnings, Deep Q Networks(DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO).
